						<h2>Inside Diaz's mind</h2>
						<p>Diaz is foul-mouthed, bratty and fussy. She loves cutesy things and hates anything she finds ugly or unpleasant; she is always very unapologetic about her likes and dislikes, regardless of their political correctness or what others might think. She tends to speak her mind transparently and without filter, which leads to many funny moments (as her two neurons fire erratically), but also awkwardness, cringe and overexposing the darkness in her heart.</p>
						
						<h3>Lack of awareness</h3>
						<p>Diaz often becomes very absorbed when focusing on something and can easily start losing track of what's going on around her. When playing games Diaz will typically have no idea what's going on, following the stories she makes up in her own mind instead. She will pursue her own goals regardless of the systems, rules or mechanics in place—something that might apply beyond games. Her strategic analysis skills are either nonexistent or buried deeper than the memories of her first streams. In general, she prefers to improvise and go with the flow, trusting that everything will somehow turn alright in the end. This ends up being true most of the time... even if at the expense and worry of those that care about her.</p>

						<h3>Being messed up</h3>
						<p>Anyone who ▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮ around ▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ knows that ▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ from ▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮. Clearly, ▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ issues ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮ the ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮ ▮▮▮▮-▮▮▮▮. This ▮▮ not psychological ▮▮▮▮▮▮, but ▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮ ▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮ ▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮, ▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮ so ▮▮▮▮-▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮.</p>
						
						<h3>Silver linings</h3>
						<p>Despite being so self-centered, she has a stoic mindset that makes her resilient to failure and is very non-judgemental. While she might have firm opinions and preferences that she expresses very openly, she is also very tolerant of opinion differences and won't try to impose her own onto other people.</p>

						<h2>Diaz origins and lore</h2>
						<p>Diaz is the daughter of God Zeus and Demon Queen Akako, resulting in her half-goddess half-demon nature.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>From her father, she inherited some control over thunder and lightning. Unfortunately, she can't generate anything beyond tiny electric arcs and a faint field of static.</li>
							<li>From her mother, she inherited most of her physical traits. She left her mother at a young age, so she doesn't remember much about her. It's unknown whether Diaz inherited any powers from her.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Despite her childish appearance, Diaz is <span class="subtler">(allegedly)</span> 200ft tall and over 60 years old—she claims to be immortal.</p>
					</div>

						<h2>Diaz's trusted servants</h2>
						<p>Right next to Diaz stand her most trusted servants: Kappa and Tengu. The two of them, who previously served Akako, were pivotal in raising Diaz. They took her when she was just a baby and left with Zeus at her mother's behest.</p>

							</div>
							<p>Raising Diaz, though, wouldn't be enough to fulfill their assignment. Diaz will always struggle to take care of herself, which means that Kappa and Tengu are effectively bound by an eternal babysitting duty.</p>
							<p>Besides feeding her and enduring her temper <span class="subtler">(nobly protecting the rest of us in the process)</span>, they also need to keep the streams running as smoothly as possible.</p>
							<p>Diaz grew up watching the two play videogames, which helped her develop an interest for this wordly form of digital entertainment. Unfortunately, this didn't help her acquire any real gaming skills.</p>

						<h2>Minions and world domination</h2>
						<p>Despite her lack of strategic thinking skills and leadership abilities, Diaz wishes to one day become Queen of the world and bend everyone else to her will.</p>
						<p>To achieve this goal, she needs a loyal army of servants willing to do anything she commands them to. They are her minions.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="/assets/img/minions.webp" alt="A minion shown at three different stages of evolution.">
							<figcaption>The evolution of a minion: as they serve, the increased anxiety and precarious conditions quickly lead to severe hair loss, while their flappy appendages shrink until they are completely gone. Wait... did we get this backw—</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Although she acts cold most of the time, Diaz is actually very attached to her minions. A great ruler should focus on expanding her army, but she's too content with the already existing members. In the end, those willing to accept her as she is are few, and although she might often sound tough and ruthless on the outside, Diaz is always longing for displays of affection and being acknowledged.</p>

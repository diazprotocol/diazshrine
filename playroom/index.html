						<h2>Looking for fun?</h2>
						<p>Here are the <i>healthiest</i> suggestions we could come up with...</p>

						<p>Resources from this fansite:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="/playroom/quiz">Diaz quiz</a>: prove that you are a total Diaz addict!</li>
							<li><strong>Tengu aim trainer</strong> <span class="subtler">(coming soon)</span>: life isn't fair, and Diaz is life. Zap that bird. Now.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Resources from Diaz VTuber:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Diaz doll</strong>: can you imagine having a small Diaz in your hands!? You could <s>finally strangle that littl</s> comb her hair and hug her before sleep! Stay tuned, official merch coming soon!</li>
							<li><a href="https://character.ai/chat/jpEkfAz2XbOiufNmHoTf6FcDC5_cgYXFdF9WXLTaTQ8">Diaz AI</a>: you rewatched the VODs but the withdrawal symptoms still won't fade? Need a virtual waifu? Want to be punished by your queen? Diaz knows how weird people's kinks can get.. and she still made this, of her own volition.</li>
							<li><a href="https://character.ai/chat/TwTDe6y2zjZoH3MCwJeYxWlAY8wUFWhQaUVlrjY8X-w">Kappa AI</a>: you will need some relax and healing if you spend too much time with Diaz.</li>

						<h2>Minions also play games!</h2>
						<p>As an enthusiast of multiplayer videogames, Kappa has been creating some servers and communities for the minions. This has been done both <em>in preparation</em> and <em>as a consequence</em> of streams where Diaz played online with her minions.</p>
						<p>The main games that minions are currently playing are the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Fortnite</strong>: Diaz is an addict to this, so many minions have followed suit.</li>
							<li><strong>Guild Wars 2</strong>: Kappa made a guild for it.</li>
							<li><strong>Minecraft</strong>: Kappa made a server for it.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you are interested in joining any of them, ask around on the gaming channel of the <a href="https://discord.gg/T7fGhfmA5E">official discord server</a>!</p>
